# Boilerplate

---

### "Boilerplate is a term used to describe code that is repeated in many parts of an application with little alteration. One of the most frequently voiced criticisms of the Java language is the volume of this type of code that is found in most projects. This problem is frequently a result of design decisions in various libraries, but is exacerbated by limitations in the language itself."


---

# But still, what does Lombok do ?

---

## "Project Lombok aims to reduce the prevalence of some of the worst offenders by replacing them with a simple set of annotations."

# Costs and Benefits

---

### Positives

#### Incorporating Lombok's annotations in a project can greatly reduce the number of lines of boilerplate code that are either generated in the IDE or written by hand. This results in reduced maintenance overhead, fewer bugs and more readable classes.
#### Project Lombok is largely aimed at filling gaps in the Java language.

---

### Negatives

#### As such, there is the possibility that changes to the language will take place that preclude the use of Lombok's annotations, such as the addition of first class property support. Additionally, when used in combination with annotation-based object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks, the number of annotations on data classes can begin to get unwieldy. This is largely offset by the amount of code that is superseded by the Lombok annotations. However, those who shun the frequent use of annotations may choose to look the other way.
